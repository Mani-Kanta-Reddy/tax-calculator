# ðŸ’° Tax Calculator

A production-grade, extensible Tax Calculator that computes individual tax based on dynamic slabs using the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern.  
Built with Java and Maven, and tested with JUnit 5 and JaCoCo.

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Calculate the total tax to be paid by an individual based on income and the following slabs:

| Income Slab (â‚¹)           | Tax Rate |
|---------------------------|----------|
| 0 - 3,50,000              | 0%       |
| 3,50,001 - 6,25,000       | 9%       |
| 6,25,001 - 12,00,000      | 18%      |
| 12,00,001 and above       | 35%      |

ðŸ§® **Example:** For â‚¹25,00,000 income
- 0% on first 3.5L = 0
- 9% on next 2.75L = 24,750
- 18% on next 5.75L = 1,03,500
- 35% on remaining 13L = 4,55,000
- **Total Tax = â‚¹5,83,250**
